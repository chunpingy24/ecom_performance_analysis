Comparatively, ***the company is taking 3 times longer to deliver the items***. There has been ***no improvement since 2019***, and that could have contributed to the big decrease in 2022 sales growth.

3. Steps should be taken to incrementally reduce the average total time taken for customers to receive their purchases so as to boost competitiveness of the firm and improve sales growth of the company.
